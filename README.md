# NeuralNetwork

A neural network built in Python to predict the 2025 US Open Men's Singles Winner

## The Why Behind this Project

I created this repo to gain more insight to how neural networks are working and practice `pytorch` and `numpy`. This implementation
is based on my work to my `CMPSC - 405 Deep Learning` class with some modifications that I have made to learn more. It is important to note
that there are more factors which influence the winner of a tennis tournament, but in this project I was aiming more to learn neural networks
and deep learning basics than actually predict the winner 100% (is that even possible?).

## Structure of the Project

To see the code and understand what it does visit the `src/code/main.py` file. If you want to see the data that I have been working with then visit
the `src/data/data.txt` file.

## NN Library

I will use `tinygrad` for this assignment since it is easier to learn first than `pytorch` and it's also a good introduction to deep learning and neural
network, plus after learning `tinygrad` it is easier to dive into `pytorch`.
